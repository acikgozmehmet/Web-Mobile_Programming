# Web-Mobile_Programming

Welcome to Web and Mobile Programming


This course teaches students how Web/Cloud technologies (Part 1) and Mobile technologies (Part 2) actually work as well as how to apply them to applications. 
Students will build applied programming skills using case studies for web and mobile applications 
(using web services for recognition and analysis of image, speech, sensor, social network trends,
etc.).

• Part 1 (Week 1 - 8): 

Programming for Web App for Web application using
HTML/CSS/JavaScript & MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js).

• Part 2 (Week 9 - 16): 

Programming for Mobile App (Android OS) to learn the foundations of
mobile platforms and techniques. Understand how to build a mobile application using
knowledge APIs (speech recognition, object recognition, GPS/map, movement recognition,
etc.), and learn how to lead successful mobile application projects. Mobile applications will
build using Java programming with Android Studio and SDK Tools.
